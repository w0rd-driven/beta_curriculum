## Process Mailbox

You're going to create a `Mailbox` using a process which loops and receives messages.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
mailbox_process = spawn(fn -> Mailbox.loop() end)
```

You should be able to send the `Mailbox` a message to add a virtual letter to the mailbox.
Print the current list of letters during every loop to prove your spawned process is storing every message in its state.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
send(mailbox_process, {:mail, "You've Got Mail!"})
# ["You've Got Mail!"]

send(mailbox_process, {:mail, "You've Got Mail..Again!"})
# ["You've Got Mail..Again!", "You've Got Mail!"]
```

We won't typically work directly with processes like this. Instead we'll rely on abstractions such as [GenServer](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html) which we will learn about in a future lesson.

<summary>Example Solution</summary>

```elixir
defmodule Mailbox do
  def loop(state \\ []) do
    IO.inspect(state)
    receive do
      {:mail, letter} -> loop([letter | state])
    end
  end
end
```

Implement the `Mailbox` module below.

```elixir
defmodule Mailbox do
  @moduledoc """
  Documentation for `Mailbox`
  """

  @doc """
  Recursively loop and receive messages.

  ## Examples

      iex> counter_process = spawn(fn -> Mailbox.loop() end)
      iex> send(counter_process, {:mail, "Hello!"})
      :ok
  """
  def loop(state \\ []) do
    if state != [], do: IO.puts("#{inspect(state)}")

    receive do
      {:mail, message} -> loop([message | state])
    end
  end
end

mailbox_process = spawn(fn -> Mailbox.loop() end)
send(mailbox_process, {:mail, "You've Got Mail!"})
# ["You've Got Mail!"]
send(mailbox_process, {:mail, "You've Got Mail..Again!"})
# ["You've Got Mail..Again!", "You've Got Mail!"]
```

## Commit Your Progress

Run the following in your command line from the beta_curriculum folder to track and save your progress in a Git commit.
Ensure that you do not already have undesired or unrelated changes by running `git status` or by checking the source control tab in Visual Studio Code.

```
$ git checkout main
$ git checkout -b exercise-process_mailbox
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish process mailbox exercise"
$ git push origin exercise-process_mailbox
```

Then create a pull request to your `main` branch and notify your teacher by including `@BrooklinJazz` in your PR description to get feedback.
